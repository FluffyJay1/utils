# thanks

Ever feel the need to thank something, but that thing isn't capable of
receiving your gratitude? Simply type

`thanks <things>`

on your command line and the program will telepathically forward your
appreciation to those things, and channel their responses into stdout. No
matter the technical obstacles involved, this program can pin down and talk to
them all, including the weather, god, the metaphysical, and maybe even my dad.
